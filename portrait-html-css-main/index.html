Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I
Can't speak no I
Can't speak at all
I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise
Don't think that you can hide it from me
Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine
Oh I can't breathe no I can't breathe at all
Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh
Could you please be mine oh mine
Here you are I've waited so long
Hoping you would sit down to stay
'Cause with these stars I've been dancing along
Like a fool so you'd look my way
You're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
And here I sing though late in the night
Hope you know I sing just for you
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because

Don't think that you can hide it from me
Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine

Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh
Could you please be mine oh mine
Could you please be mine oh mineYou're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
Stars they dance though late in the night
Don't you know they dance just for you
There you are above darkened clouds
Smiling at the world from afar
With the stars you wander around
May they follow you wherever you are
Here I am just another boy
Singing songs that others have sung
Trying to find the words to employ
To adore the goddess of love
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase

Could you please be mine oh mineYou're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
Stars they dance though late in the night
Don't you know they dance just for you
There you are above darkened clouds
Smiling at the world from afar
With the stars you wander around
May they follow you wherever you are
Here I am just another boy
Singing songs that others have sung
Trying to find the words to employ
To adore the goddess of love
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I
Can't speak no I
Can't speak at all
I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise
Don't think that you can hide it from me
Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine
Oh I can't breathe no I can't breathe at all
Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh
Could you please be mine oh mine
Here you are I've waited so long
Hoping you would sit down to stay
'Cause with these stars I've been dancing along
Like a fool so you'd look my way
You're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up the world when it's blue
And here I sing though late in the night
Hope you know I sing just for you
Oh you got me in a daze yeah
No it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I Can't speak</p>
